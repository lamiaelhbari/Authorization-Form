# *Authorization Form*

## üéØ *Project Objective*
***Authorization Form*** *is designed to demonstrate how to create a `simple authorization system in React`. In this project, you'll create a password-protected contact page where users can only access the contact information after entering the correct password. This project will help you understand `conditional rendering`, `managing state` with `useState`, and `handling form submissions in React`.*

## üîç *Features*
- ***Conditional Rendering*** *: Displays either the contact information or a password prompt based on the user's authorization status.*
- ***Password Protection*** *: The contact information is hidden by default and can be accessed only after entering the correct password.*
- ***Form Handling*** *: Includes a simple form with a password input field that triggers the authorization process.*
- ***State Management*** *: Uses `useState` to track whether the user is authorized or not.*

## üõ†Ô∏è *Technologies Used*
- ***`HTML`*** *: Basic structure for the application.*
- ***`CSS`*** *: Styling and layout.*
- ***`JavaScript`*** *: Programming logic.*
- ***`React`*** *: Library for creating a dynamic user interface.*
- ***`JSX`*** *: JavaScript syntax extension for `creating React elements` and rendering them conditionally.*

## üß† *Logic and Methods Used*
### üìù *`JSX` and `React`*
- ***`JSX`*** *: Used to combine HTML structure and JavaScript logic in a way that is intuitive for building dynamic user interfaces.*
- ***`useState()`*** *: `React hook` used to track the state of user authorization (authorized or not).*
- ***Conditional Rendering*** *: Displays either the login form or the contact info based on the `authorized` state.*

### üñ•Ô∏è *Handling Form Submission*
- ***`handleSubmit()`*** *: Function that checks if the entered password matches and updates the `authorized` state accordingly.*
- ***Form Handling*** *: The form captures the user input and triggers the `handleSubmit()` function on submission to check the password.*
